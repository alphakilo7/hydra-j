# Members of *RelativeLayout*

## Member Methods

`public void $(JComponent child, int position, JComponent parent)`
This method, as can be observed, takes three parameters to work.
JComponent child  : This is the component to be placed relative to something.

int position      : This is the position relative to the parent (top, bottom, left, right).

JComponent parent : The parent to which child will be relative.
